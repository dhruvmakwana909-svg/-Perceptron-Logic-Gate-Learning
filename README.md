 Perceptron Logic Gate Learning 

A custom Perceptron neural network implemented using pure mathematics to learn and classify basic binary logic gate operations.

Uses vector math from NumPy

Step activation function for binary classification

Trained on truth table inputs: [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]

Learns:

AND logic

OR logic

NOR logic (inverted OR behavior)

Visual intuition using Matplotlib

Auto-updates weights & bias when predictions are wrong

Prints final weights, bias, and predictions

Plots learned decision boundaries

Gate	Output	Learnable

AND	[0 0 0 1]	✔ Yes

OR	[0 1 1 1]	✔ Yes

NOR	[1 0 0 0]	✔ Yes
