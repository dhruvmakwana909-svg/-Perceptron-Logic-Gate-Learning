🧠 Perceptron Logic Gate Learning (From Scratch)

A custom Perceptron neural network implemented using pure mathematics to learn and classify basic binary logic gate operations.

🚀 Features

Uses vector math from NumPy

Step activation function for binary classification

Trained on truth table inputs: [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]

Learns:

AND logic

OR logic

NOR logic (inverted OR behavior)

Visual intuition using Matplotlib

Auto-updates weights & bias when predictions are wrong

Prints final weights, bias, and predictions

Plots learned decision boundaries

✅ Learnable Gates

Gate	Output	Learnable

AND	[0 0 0 1]	✔ Yes

OR	[0 1 1 1]	✔ Yes

NOR	[1 0 0 0]	✔ Yes
